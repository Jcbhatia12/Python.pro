# Tuple Out Dice Game

This program simulates a two-player dice game called "Tuple Out". Players take turns rolling dice to score points, with the goal of reaching 50 points first.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `tuple_out.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `tuple_out.py`.
5. Run the command: `python tuple_out.py`

## How to Play

1. The game alternates between Player 1 and Player 2.
2. On each turn, the player rolls three dice.
3. If all three dice show the same number, the player "tuples out" and scores 0 for that turn.
4. If two dice show the same number, they become "fixed" and cannot be re-rolled.
5. The player can choose to re-roll any unfixed dice or end their turn and score the sum of all dice.
6. The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game.

Follow the on-screen prompts to make decisions during your turn. Enjoy the game!
